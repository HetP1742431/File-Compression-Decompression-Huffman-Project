# File Compression-Decompression Website (Huffman Coding)

## ðŸš€ Live Demo
Check out the live deployed version of the app [here](https://file-compression-decompression-huffman.onrender.com).

ðŸ“š **Project Overview**  
The File Compression-Decompression website is a web-based application designed to efficiently compress and decompress files using the Huffman coding algorithm. This project provides a practical implementation of a lossless data compression technique, enabling users to reduce file sizes for optimal storage and transmission, and later restore the files to their original state.

ðŸ›  **Core Features**  
- **Huffman Coding Implementation**:  
  The core of this project is built around Huffman coding, implemented from scratch in pure Python. This algorithm assigns shorter binary codes to more frequently occurring characters, resulting in reduced file sizes without any loss of data integrity.
  
- **File Compression and Decompression**:  
  Users can upload files to be compressed into a `.huf` format, specifically designed for efficient transmission. The service also allows for the decompression of `.huf` files back to their original form, making the application a complete solution for file size optimization.

- **User-Friendly Web Interface**:  
  Built with HTML, CSS, and Flask, the web interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Users can upload files, compress or decompress them, and download the results directly from the website.

- **Dynamic File Handling**:  
  The backend efficiently handles file uploads, processing, and downloads, ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions. Files are managed securely and are automatically cleared after processing to maintain an efficient workflow.

ðŸ›  **Tech Stack**  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
- **Algorithm**: Huffman Coding (Implemented in Python)  
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn, Render

ðŸ’¡ **What I Learned**  
This project was a deep dive into data compression algorithms, specifically Huffman coding, and their practical applications in real-world scenarios. Implementing Huffman coding from scratch solidified my understanding of binary tree structures and lossless data compression techniques. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in building and deploying a full-stack web application using Flask, handling dynamic file operations, and managing backend processes.

Throughout the development process, I honed my problem-solving skills and improved my ability to research and implement complex algorithms. This project also enhanced my proficiency in developing user-friendly web interfaces and deploying applications in production environments. Overall, this experience has made me a more proficient software engineer with a stronger foundation in both algorithmic thinking and web development.
